# Water-Wise
This is just a mini project for "UX/UI for an IOT enabled Smart Controller Design of a Mobile App" which i made using Figma Software.
<br><br><br>
(1)App Installation and Setup:

After installing the app, you'll see the app's logo, name, and a brief description. 
<br>
<br>

It will ask for your login details (like name and address) and help you connect to the IoT Smart Controller Unit for water management. You can set up multiple systems (e.g., multiple water tanks) using the app.

<br><br>

(2)Once the app is set up, you can monitor real-time data:<br><br>
-Check the water level in your tank.(on clicking the tab user can see more details like estimated time when the tank will be empty)<br><br>
-Monitor the water level in your houseplants.(on clicking this tab more details can be seen)<br><br>

<br><br>

(3)Customized Settings:<br>

Customize settings based on your preferences:<br>
-Set a water level threshold to turn on the motor (e.g., turn on the motor when the tank is 50% full) and receive notifications.<br>
-Set a soil moisture level for watering plants (e.g., water plants when soil moisture is below 30%).<br><br>


(4)Receive notifications for:<br>
-Power outage alerts.<br>
-Motor activation based on set thresholds.<br>
-Plant watering based on soil moisture levels.<br>
